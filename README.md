HandyText
--------------

Purpose
--------------
HandyText is a helper library that allows to create and manage text styles in a clear declarative manner.

Problem solved
--------------

Work on UI tasks is full of repetition when it goes about defining text appearance. You have to refer to mockups all the time, or to search and copy elements of same appearance. Both ways leave many ways for errors, and both make late changes in design quite painful. Amount of work for changing a font in typical elements is proportional to project's size.
The alternative way is in avoiding the use of IB for defining text appearance, but handling it in code. 


Supported OS & SDK Versions
-----------------------------

Swift 6.0
* Supported build target - iOS 15.0 and up (Xcode 16)

Installation
--------------

To integrate SnapKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/molfar-io-dev/HandyText.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.5.0"))
]
```

Declare own text styles as static functions or properties of TextStyle class.

Version 1.5.0

- Release version.

Usage
--------------

First, let's define some text styles:

```swift
extension TextStyle {
  static var plainText: TextStyle {
    return TextStyle(font: .avenir)
  }
}
```

The Font is only required parameter for creating a brand new style, all other params are set to defaults. Instead of copying instances and modifying properties the library proposes more declarative 'cascade' style. Think you need a style for headers based on plain text:

```swift
  static var header1: TextStyle {
    return plainText.withSizeMultiplied(by: 1.4).uppercase().bold()
  }
```

It's remarkable that styles are chained, in other words based on each other. Changing basic style font to .georgia makes all style scheme look different, but still well fitted.

Attributed strings
----------------

The costs of using text styles is switching to attributed text, which is supported by the most of UIKit classes.
```swift
label.attributedText = "Hello, World!".withStyle(.plainText)
```
 <img src="img/01.png" width="200">

### Merging attributed strings
Attributed strings can be combined to achieve more complex appearance:
```swift
let title = "First name: ".withStyle(.placeholder)
let name = "Michael".withStyle(.plainText)
label.attributedText = title + name
 ```
 <img src="img/02.png" width="300">

### Highlighting words
You can highlight specific substrings with a different text style:
```swift
let text = "There are three species of zebras: the plains zebra, the Grévy's zebra and the mountain zebra"
label.attributedText = text.withStyle(.plainText).applyStyle(.header1, toOccurencesOf: "zebra")
```
 <img src="img/03.png" width="400">


For displaying strings with tags you define a tag scheme:
```swift
    let scheme = TagScheme()
    scheme.forTag("b") { $0.bold() }
    scheme.forTag("i") { $0.italic() }
```
In the scheme for each custom tag you register a block defining the modification of the initial text style.
Nested tags are supported. Text marked as following ```"<i><b>lions</b></i>"``` will be bold italic.
To convert a string into an attributed string:
```swift
let result = "about <i>zebras</i>".withStyle(.plainText, tagScheme: scheme)
```

FAQ
--------------
### How many styles do I need? 
As little as possible. Average application has 2-3 basic and several complementary text styles. It's not necessary to create a new style if it differs with only the color or alignment. Better to extend the style at place. 

### Absolute or relative size?
You are used to define text size in points: 10 for plain text, 15 for heading and so on. But let's look from another angle: what this numbers mean? I guess, the designer could think something like 'let headers be a half times more than normal text'. Due to method ```withSizeMultiplied(by:)``` you can define text sizes proportionally. In this case, when the base style changes its size, the whole text scheme scales proportionally. Baseline offset can also be defined relative, which will keep proportions in custom superscripts like below:

### What can make the text size change?
Here are some ideas. By using Dynamic Text Size in the base style, you will make your app sensitive to the Accessibility preferences of the device. For large devices it's reasonable to use slightly larger fonts. Some apps allow users to change appearance themes. With HandyText updating fonts becomes a simple task.

### Too many outlets!
To use HandyText effectively you must create an outlet for every text containing view. Is it that bad? In well-designed projects all strings are kept in the single file: Localizable.strings. Not in storyboards, not in the code. With this approach the whole app can be translated into a new language without changing a line of code. HandyText lib encourages you to use this approach: fetch a localized string, apply a style, display the result in the corresponding outlet.

### How to add links to my attributed text?
The library doesn't add any new abilities to UIKit classes. For assigning a link to a chunk of text it uses NSLinkAttributeName. For more info refer to the [official docs](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uitextviewdelegate/1649337-textview).

### How do I call my text styles?
Avoid giving names based on specific usage, try to keep it more generic. For instance, 'screenHeading' is a good name, 'orangeHeaderInFriendsList' – is not.

### Can HandyText help me improve my design specs?
Of course. As a developer, together with design team you can define a table of common text styles and rules for describing modifiers. Instead of "HelveticaNeue-Bold, 15 pt, color: FF0000" it can be "style: header, color: tomatoRed".
